This code is a modified version from the revision 9 of javaemvreader(https://code.google.com/p/javaemvreader/)
for building android-se-access(https://github.com/nelenkov/android-se-access)

if you build the android-se-access project with the latest version of javaemvreader, you may get theerror messages like 
	"Error:(4, 16) java: cannot find symbol
	: class ApplicationDefinitionFile
	location: package sasc.emv"
	"Error:(8, 16) java: cannot find symbol
  	:   class EMVCard
  	location: package sasc.emv"

I digged out amost all revisions of javaemvreader svn repository and found out 
that the revision 9 has the fewest errors in binding to android-se-access.
I modified and added a few lines to the revision 9.
